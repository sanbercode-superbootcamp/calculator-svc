# Tugas 7 Calculator w/ Service

## Introduction
As task 6, this task is about creating calculator function wtih typescript. Homewer, It has a little bit different. It runs server with service. Although, the service is just calculator functions such as addition, subsctract, multiply, and not to mention division. Inspite of service implementation, the folder is divided into two, they are "src" as source folder and "dist" as distribution folder. Hope you enjoy it!
